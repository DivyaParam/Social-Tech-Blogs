During my time working as a 'Technical Writer' for Zoho, I worked for two products Zoho Cliq (A chat based web application) and Zoho Social (A social media management application). I worked alongside the platforms, marketing, and the finance team and went about documenting a bunch of low code self building modules specific to each product. I soemtimes worked on even building chat bots that could bring in all the work from multiple applications without you having to jump between windows. I documented the REST APIs for partner teams, development teams, and third-party users by testing them on POSTMAN. Apart from this I worked with the support team in periodically answering customer queries heliping them move about each product.

Here are a bunch of technical blogs that I wrote during my time working as a Technical Writer for Zoho! Give it a read, I'm sure you will like it :)
